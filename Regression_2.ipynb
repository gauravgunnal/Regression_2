    "2. **Penalty Term**:\n",
    "   - Ridge regression adds the squared magnitude of coefficients to the objective function, leading to a \\( L2 \\) norm penalty. It penalizes large coefficients but does not necessarily set them to zero.\n",
    "   - Lasso regression adds the absolute magnitude of coefficients to the objective function, leading to a \\( L1 \\) norm penalty. It tends to produce sparse models by setting some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection**:\n",
    "   - Ridge regression tends to shrink the coefficients towards zero, but it rarely sets them exactly to zero. Thus, it keeps all variables in the model, albeit with reduced impact.\n",
    "   - Lasso regression, due to the nature of the \\( L1 \\) penalty, can perform variable selection by setting some coefficients to zero. This leads to a more parsimonious model with fewer predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Geometric Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - The \\( L2 \\) penalty in ridge regression corresponds to a circular constraint in the coefficient space.\n",
    "   - The \\( L1 \\) penalty in lasso regression corresponds to a diamond-shaped constraint, which tends to intersect the axes, promoting sparsity in the coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use Lasso Regression:\n",
    "- When there are a large number of predictors and you believe that only a subset of them are truly important, lasso regression's ability for variable selection can be beneficial.\n",
    "- When interpretability of the model is important and you want to identify the most relevant predictors while excluding irrelevant ones.\n",
    "- When there is multicollinearity among predictors, as lasso tends to select only one variable from a group of highly correlated variables, effectively reducing model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, lasso regularization, with its \\( L1 \\) norm penalty, offers a method for both regularization and feature selection, making it a valuable tool in situations where sparse models or variable selection are desired.'''"
